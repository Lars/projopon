This is a fast clobered together README for project projopon

The idea is to create a web based outliner that is compatible and
capable of receiving and sending Kylom Software's Projekt exported
OPML files. 

Projekt (found at http://www.kylom.com/ ) is a project manager and
outliner for Symbian S60 systems, that I have recently purchased for
my E71 phone... so far it's a very nice outliner program for the S60
but even with a "full" qwerty keyboard on my phone, it's not feasible
to do an extended dump session onto the device itself. thus needing
a nicer UI.

I chose Web to be all "cloudy" about it. Projekt is capable of exporting
and importing part (not all) of it's data in XML, to be more precise, OPML
format.

Projopon (PROJekt OPml ONline) is then designed to be usseable as a web outliner
that can receive (via email at first) and export (the same) projekt compatible
OPML files. Letting me "sync" via email projekt to the web.
